Originally, the bot used to be hosted on Heroku, so supporting Heroku was an essential part of the project.
Now I don't have access to Heroku and cannot guarantee that it will work.

If you're interested in running the bot on Heroku, you may find files in this directory useful.
Edit them to your needs and put into the root of the project.
